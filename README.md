# DeepBoardGameLearning

## Goal:

Application of Keras to create a Machine Learning Model to predict the popularity of a board game based on BoardGameGeek(BGG) Stats and Amazon Pricing.

## Steps 

### Scraping (100+ games)

Use beautifulsoup to scrape the BGG xml api and use Amazon api for useful information that can be used to train the machine learning model.

### Data Cleaning

Match the data collected by both sources into a Pandas dataframe

### Model Decision

Find which type of model will work for this task.

### Model Calibration

Find the configuration that will make the most accurate model
