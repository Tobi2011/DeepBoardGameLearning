# DeepBoardGameLearning

## Goal:

Application of Keras to create a Machine Learning Model to predict the popularity of a board game based on Kickstarter Stats

## Steps 

### Scraping

Using Python to look through Kickstarter Data and extract information that can be processed for modeling

### Data Cleaning

Clearn data

### Model Decision

A classification strategy was used for different types of model inputs


### Model Calibration

Used GridSearchCV from Sci-kit library to calibrate the stats model

Please take a look at the jupyter notebook in this Repo
